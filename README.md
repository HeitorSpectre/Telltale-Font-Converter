# Telltale Font Converter

## What does it do? ü§î

Simply put, it takes the font files from Telltale games (those classic `.fnt + .png` pairs) and converts them into a single TrueType Font file (`.ttf`).  
Once you have the `.ttf`, you can install it on your system and use it in any program ‚Äî like Photoshop, FontForge, or any other font editor!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does It Work?

The process is super simple and broken down into a few steps:

1. **Give your project a name**  
   Just a name to help you identify the font you're creating  
   _Example: "The Walking Dead Main Font"_

2. **Upload the `.fnt` file**  
   The tool will read the data from the file and figure out which texture files (`.png`) are needed.

3. **Upload the `.png` files**  
   The tool will prompt you to upload the correct image files one by one.  
   It even checks if the filenames match what‚Äôs expected!

4. **Select the Characters**  
   Tick the boxes for the character sets you want to include.

5. **Generate the `.ttf`**  
   With a single click, the tool will process the images and data to generate and download your ready-to-use `.ttf` file.
